# Plex Status

[Electron](https://electronjs.org) app to display whether or not [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) is running in your Mac's menubar - so you don't close your laptop while streaming something!

## Getting Started

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn`)
1.  Execute `npm start` in your terminal
1.  You should see a new icon in your Mac's menubar! It will refresh every 5 minutes to see if Plex is streaming something.
